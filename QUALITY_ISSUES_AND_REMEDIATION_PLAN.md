## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: BROKEN & IRRELEVANT INTERNAL LINKS (40% of total impact)
**Severity**: CRITICAL ❌

**Problems Found**:
- ❌ FAQ answer references "Brooks Glycerin Max Comfortable Long-Run" (should link to running tips, not shoe reviews)
- ❌ FAQ answer references "EVO SL Reimagined for Winter" (off-topic Adidas shoe review)
- ❌ FAQ answer references "2026 Ultimate Guide Top Best" (vague, broken semantic meaning)
- ❌ FAQ answer references "Ultimate 2026 Ranking Best Kidney" (COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT - kidney function has nothing to do with running)
- ❌ FAQ answer references "2026' Ultimate Crossfit Jump Rope" (CrossFit not relevant to weight loss running)
- ❌ FAQ answer references "COROS Pace In-Depth Review" (only tangentially relevant)
- ❌ Internal links are shoe/equipment reviews, NOT comprehensive guides on running for weight loss
- ❌ No links to actual running plan guides or nutrition strategies
- ❌ Links appear randomly inserted, not contextually relevant

**Expected Impact**: -30 E-E-A-T score, -15 readability, breaks topical authority

**Fix Required**: Replace with SEMANTIC LINKS to:
- "/running-plan-to-lose-weight/" from Table of Contents

9. "What's the best time of day to run for weight loss?" - 80 words (needs circadian rhythm science)
